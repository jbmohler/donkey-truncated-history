I was reminded of this game by a Moravian Student Math conference talk using a
linear programming problem to solve sudoku.

Note that version 5 has a post fix_point hunk of code that is not so hot with
the data structures as they are.  It's next point chooser also would benefit
from another data structure.  The timing bears out that a data structure change
might be a good idea -- the algorithm appears solid for hard puzzles, but it's
not so great for easy puzzles.

The wikipedia article at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmics_of_sudoku
has some nice example difficult games.
